# House-Rent-Prediction
The rent of a house depends on a lot of factors. With appropriate data and Machine Learning techniques, many real estate platforms find the housing options according to the customerâ€™s budget.
# Introduction 
The rent of a housing property depends on a lot of factors like:
<br>
number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen
<br>
size of the property
<br>
the floor of the house
<br>
area type
<br>
area locality
<br>
City
<br>
furnishing status of the house
<br>
To build a house rent prediction system, we need data based on the factors affecting the rent of a housing property.
# Usage
Jupyter notebook, supervised learning
# Conclusion
This House Rent Prediction project demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems by accurately estimating rental prices based on key features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. By leveraging data-driven insights, this model can assist both tenants and property owners in making informed decisions. The project not only highlights the practical application of regression techniques but also emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Future improvements could include incorporating more granular location data, real-time market trends, and user feedback for enhanced accuracy and personalization.
